# 🦫 Project Diary: Damn Beavers

This document serves as a dev log and scratchpad for the **Damn Beavers** project.

## 📅 Log Entries

### 2026-01-24
*   **Project Kickoff**:
    *   The project concept and initial text for `README.md` were generated using **Gemini Canvas**.
    *   Converted the plain text `README.md` into structured Markdown.
    *   Initialized this `NOTES.md` file to track progress and decisions.
    *   Created `DEV.md` to document the project setup, dependencies, and build instructions.
    *   **Troubleshooting**: Encountered an issue with `npx tailwindcss init` due to a version mismatch (Tailwind v4 vs v3 workflow). Downgraded to Tailwind v3.4.17 to ensure compatibility with standard init commands.
    *   Successfully configured Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.
    *   Created a basic UI shell in `App.tsx` to verify the stack.
    *   Set up testing environment with **Vitest**, **React Testing Library**, and **jsdom**.
    *   Verified setup with initial tests in `src/test/App.test.tsx`.

## 🧠 Backlog & Ideas
*   [x] Set up React + Vite environment.
*   [x] Configure Tailwind CSS customization (colors, fonts).
*   [ ] Implement basic resource ticking loop (Wood, Mud, Food).
*   [ ] Sketch out UI layout for the three-column dashboard.
